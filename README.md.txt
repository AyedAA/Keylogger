# 🔑 Keylogger.exe by AyedAA - Windows Keystroke Logger (For Educational Purposes Only)

## 📖 About
`keylogger.exe` is a simple keystroke logging tool designed for **educational purposes** and **cybersecurity awareness**. It captures keystrokes and stores them in a `keyfile.txt` file. 

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This tool is intended for **ethical research and personal security testing only**. Any unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.

## ⚡ Features
- ✅ Captures all keystrokes, including special keys.
- ✅ Runs in the background silently.
- ✅ Logs keystrokes into a file (`keyfile.txt`).
- ✅ No external dependencies required (standalone `.exe`).

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
1. **Download** `keylogger.exe` and place it in your desired location.
2. **Run** `keylogger.exe` (Double-click to start logging).
3. **Check the logs**: Keystrokes will be stored in `keyfile.txt` in the same folder.
4. **To Stop the Logger**, open **Task Manager** (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`), find `keylogger.exe`, and **end the process**.

## 🚀 Notes
- Running `keylogger.exe` in a new location will create a fresh `keyfile.txt`.
- If **antivirus** flags it as a threat, add it to the exclusions list (since it logs keystrokes).
- Modify the original Python script to customize logging behavior.
